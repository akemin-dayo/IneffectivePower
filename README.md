IneffectivePower
================

**Works on iOS 8 only. Has arm64 support. Works on iPhone, iPod touch, and iPad. (just like everything else I write)**

IneffectivePower is a tweak I wrote that stops the infamous "Effective Power" text string from crashing CoreText on a system-wide level. This means it should work in every app.

In the event that you somehow find yet another way to crash CoreText in any app, notify me by email (with a symbolicated crash log) and I'll look into it.
